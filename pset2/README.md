# APComp 221

## General

We are using Python 3 (any version should work). We also use PyTest for testing purposes. 

## Run tests

First install pytest:

    pip3 install pytest
    pytest

To run an individual test:

    pytest -k clean_csv

## Data Analysis

count_columns helps us understand the distribution of corrupt lines by counting how many columns are found in the csv.

Example usage: 

```
python3 src/count_columns.py output/clean.csv
```

## Problem 1

```
python3 src/clean_csv.py datasets/dirty_sample_small.csv output/clean.csv
```

## Problem 2

```
python3 
```

## Problem 3

```
python3 
```
